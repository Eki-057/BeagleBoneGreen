# Networking examples

This directory contains socket programming examples for the BeagleBone Green.
They are organized by project so you can pick the level of complexity you
need:

- `basic_tcp/` – Minimal scripts that demonstrate how to open a TCP
  connection between two boards, exchange a greeting, and echo messages.
- `chat/` – A small asynchronous group chat server and client that showcase
  how to build richer TCP applications with Python's `asyncio` module.

Each subfolder provides usage instructions and any additional notes that are
specific to that example.
