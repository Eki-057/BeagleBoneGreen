# Python examples

This directory collects the Python material for the BeagleBone Green.

- `games/` contains small terminal games created while learning the language.  They do not target the board specifically but are kept here as reference exercises.
- `gpio/` holds hardware interaction demos that use `libgpiod` to toggle pins.
- `sensors/` includes code for environmental sensors such as the BME280.

Refer to the README inside each subdirectory for instructions on required dependencies and how to run the scripts.
