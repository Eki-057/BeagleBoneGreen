# Python games

This folder collects small terminal games and programming exercises. They are not specific to the BeagleBone Green, but they are kept here as examples used while learning Python.

- `chicken_game.py` – Reaction game that challenges players to press a key before time runs out.
- `minigame*.py` – Variations of a number guessing challenge with incremental improvements.
- `multi_game_v2.py` – Menu-driven collection of several simple games.
- `multiplication_game.py` – Math practice game for multiplication tables.
- `pig_game.py` – Text-based version of the Pig dice game.
