This Python script toggles a GPIO pin on the BeagleBone Green, creating a blinking effect for an LED connected to a specified GPIO line. It uses the gpiod library (libgpiod) for low-level GPIO control and is suitable for systems using the newer character device GPIO interface (e.g., /dev/gpiochipX).

Required library:
sudo apt-get install python3-libgpiod

GPIO Line 28 corresponds to a specific physical pin on the BeagleBone Green header. 
Those are P9-1 (Minus cable) and P9-12 (Positive cable).
